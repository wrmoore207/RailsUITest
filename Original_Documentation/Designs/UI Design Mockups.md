The resource list is useful for organizations in need of resources. All can access and add requested resources for consolidated information sharing.

### Dashboard View
The dashboard UI is a stretch goal (TBD), however, it'd serve as a comprehensive dashboard view displaying class schedules, enrollment/waitlist links, busy times, and contact information for each affiliated organization.
