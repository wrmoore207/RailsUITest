## Overview

**ESOL Hub** is a modern web application designed to streamline communication between organizations and individuals seeking English language support. The platform offers an easy-to-use event calendar, searchable resource listings, and future expansion into forums and file-sharing.

This project is a Capstone project completed by Northeastern Graduate students Cody Snow, Sam Treadwell, and Ryan Moore. The goal of the project was to develop a web app that allows members of Portland, Maine's ESOL collaborative to share information about courses and resources in a centralized location.
